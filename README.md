  _Answer_

_ useState Hook Usage:
  _The useState hook is imported from 'react' and used to declare and manage state variables within functional components.

_ State Variables:
  _Several state variables are declared in the App and Home components using the useState hook
  _count: In the App component, it keeps track of a count, although it doesn't seem to be used in this code snippet.
  _allCourses: In the Home component, it stores the list of all available courses fetched from a JSON file
  _selectedCourses: Also in the Home component, it maintains the list of courses selected by the user.
  _totalCost: This variable tracks the total cost of the selected courses in the Home component.
  _remaining: It keeps track of the remaining credit hours available for selection in the Home component.

_ Updating State:
  _State variables are updated using the functions returned by the useState hook (e.g., setAllCourses, setSelectedCourses, setTotalCost, and setRemaining)
